# Stage Map Icons

Tour de France stage map style icons in Scalable Vector Format for use in GIS applications

## Installation

### QGIS 3.x
The correct location for user defined SVG symbols in QGIS 3.X has to be checked by opening `Settings | User Profiles | Open Active Profile Folder`.

If necessary, create an `svg` folder in this location. Then , QGIS will recognize it as the User's `svg` folder.

Copy the `Stage Map` folder from this repository to the `svg` folder.
